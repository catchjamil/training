Color Encryption: As an illustration let us assume that the data
has to be sent to a receiver (say A) who is assigned the color
raspberry (135, 38, 87). Let the key values to be added with
this color value be (-10, +5, +5). Let the Armstrong number
used for data encryption be 153.
Step 1: (Creating password)
Initially the sender knows the required receiver to be A.
So the key values are added with the color values assigned
for receiver A.
135 38 87
-10 5 5
-------------------------
125 43 92
Now a newly encrypted color is designed for security check.

(Authenticating the receiver)
For the receiver A (as assumed) the actual color being
assigned is Raspberry. (135, 38, 87), the key values (set of
three values) are subtracted from the color being received to
get back the original color.
The decryption is as follows.

125 43 92 (Received data)
(-) -10 5 5 (Key values)
----------------------------------
135 38 87
The above set of values (135, 38, 87) is compared with the
data stored at the sender’s side.
