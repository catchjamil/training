Welcome to Struts 2 world.
	<h3>What is Apache Tiles</h3>
	Apache Tiles is a templating framework built to simplify the 
	development of web application user interfaces. Tiles allows 
	authors to define page fragments which can be assembled into 
	a complete page at runtime. These fragments, or tiles, can be 
	used as simple includes in order to reduce the duplication of 
	common page elements or embedded within other tiles to develop
	 a series of reusable templates. These templates streamline the
	  development of a consistent look and feel across an entire 
	  application. Tiles grew in popularity as a component of the
	   popular Struts framework. It has since been extracted from 
	   Struts and is now integrated with various frameworks, such 
	   as Struts 2 and Shale.
